# Contact-Mangement-System

Description:
The Contact Management System is a simple console-based application implemented in C++ that allows users to manage their contacts. It provides basic functionality such as adding new contacts, searching for existing contacts, displaying help information, and exiting the application.

Features:

Add Contact: Users can input the first name, last name, and a 10-digit phone number to add a new contact. The contact details are then saved in a file named "number.txt."

Search Contact: Users can search for a contact based on the first or last name. The system reads the contact information from the "number.txt" file and displays the details if a match is found.

Help: The application provides a simple help message to guide users on how to use the system.

Exit: Users can choose to exit the application gracefully.

File Handling:
The contact details are stored in a text file for persistence, allowing users to access their contacts across sessions.

Input Validation:
The system includes basic input validation for the phone number, ensuring it contains 10 digits and consists of numeric characters only.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler.
